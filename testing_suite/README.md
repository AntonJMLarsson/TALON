### Testing Suite
These small tests are designed to check whether specific parts of TALON are behaving as expected. To run all of the tests, enter the command "pytest" in this directory. 

In between testing, run the command 'make clean' to delete intermediate files created by the testing suite. This is essential since the TALON database initialization test will fail by default if this isn't done.
