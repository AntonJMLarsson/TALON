### Testing Suite
These tests are designed to check whether specific parts of TALON are behaving as expected.
A single command is sufficient to run the entire testing suite, but it is also possible to run select groups of tests at a time if desired.
```
# Run all tests
make test

# Run only unit tests
make unit

# Run only integration tests
make integration

# Remove temporary files generated by tests
make clean
```
