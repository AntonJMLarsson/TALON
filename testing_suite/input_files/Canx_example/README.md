# Canx test case
In the first mouse TALON run I did, I noticed that a transcript mapped to the Canx locus was misclassified as genomic/antisense when the genome browser clearly indicated that it was either ISM-suffix or NNC.

```
grep "Canx" /bio/dwyman/pacbio_f2016/data/GENCODEvM7/gencode.vM7.annotation.gtf > Canx.gtf
```
